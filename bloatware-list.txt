this list is meant to be used for lisitng all the known bloatware that may be found on a windows machine. 
Either from the manufacturer as a OOB (Out of box) provided install or as a user-installed (by mistake, hopefully) bloat that is found on the system.

using this list as it seems pretty comprehensive:
